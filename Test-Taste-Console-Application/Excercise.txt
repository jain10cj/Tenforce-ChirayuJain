Propose in less than 5 lines an alternative solution to this problem (if possible) and explain a 
benefit and a drawback versus the solution that you have chosen.

Solution-
As an alternative solution we can make AverageMoonGravity property as getter setter type.

Benefit of this solution we get to have the control over the return values and 
values can be set to instance variable

Drawback would be this property can be set to any value by any other object and 
can be set outside the class.

It can be written as 

public float AverageMoonGravity {get;set;}

and in constructor we can define the value as

public Planet(PlanetDto planetDto)
        {
            Id = planetDto.Id;
            SemiMajorAxis = planetDto.SemiMajorAxis;
            Moons = new Collection<Moon>();
            if(planetDto.Moons != null)
            {
                foreach (MoonDto moonDto in planetDto.Moons)
                {
                    Moons.Add(new Moon(moonDto));
                }
                AverageMoonGravity = planetDto.Moons.Average(moon => moon.MassValue);
            }
            else
            {
                AverageMoonGravity = 0.0;
            }
        }
